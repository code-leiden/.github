# Community Guidelines

Hey there! Welcome to Code Leiden. We're all here to learn, code, and have fun together. Here are some simple guidelines to keep our community awesome:

## The Basics

**Be respectful.** Everyone is on their own learning path. Some of us are just starting out, others have been coding for years. That's what makes our community great!

**Help each other out.** Got a question? Ask it! Know the answer? Share it! We learn best when we learn together.

**Be patient.** Remember, we all started somewhere. If someone's struggling with something that seems easy to you, take a moment to help them understand.

**Keep it positive.** Encourage your fellow members. Celebrate wins, no matter how small. We're here to support each other.

## What We're About

- Learning and growing together as developers
- Respecting that everyone has different experience levels and learns at their own pace

## Not Cool

- Any form of harassment or discrimination

## If Something's Wrong
